# Comparative-Analysis-Of-SMS-Spam-Classification
Developed a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham using SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms.The dataset collected from Kaggle, titled ”SMS spam collection database”, it includes a total of 5573 message samples that will be used for classification purposes. Implemented using text preprocessing techniques like text cleaning, and tokenization. Evaluation showed SVM(97.7%) performed better than Naive Bayes(96.12%) in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
